## Draw your pixel art

In this step you will draw your pixel art pattern in the Scene view.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Pixel art grew out of <span style="color: #0faeb0">the limited resolution and colours</span> available to developers of early video games and computer graphics. This style became popular in the <span style="color: #0faeb0">1980s and 1990s</span> â€” the simple and distinctive designs still provoke a sense of nostalgia amongst gamers and artists alike.

### Drag materials to pixels

--- task ---

Design your pixel art by dragging materials onto the cubes in your grid. 

**Tip:** If you drag a material onto the wrong cube, you can press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>cmd</kbd> and <kbd>z</kbd> to undo, or just drag a different material on.

With **all** of the Floor cubes selected, add a script called `ChangeMaterial`:

--- code ---

language: cs 
filename: ChangeMaterial.cs 
line_numbers: true 
line_number_start: 1 
line_highlights: 
---

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class ChangeMaterial : MonoBehaviour
{
  public Material start;
  public Material reveal;
  Renderer rend;

  // Start is called before the first frame update
  void Start()
  {
      rend = GetComponent<Renderer>();
      reveal = rend.sharedMaterial;
      rend.sharedMaterial = start;
  }

  void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
  {
      if (collision.gameObject.tag == "Player"){
          rend.sharedMaterial = reveal;
      }
  }

}

Select **all** of the Floor cubes and add a Box Collider.

**Choose** a start material for your Floor tiles. With **all** of the Floor cubes selected, drag the start material into the ChangeMaterial `Start` variable.

**Test:** If you play your scene at this point, all the tiles should change to your start colour, but you don't have a way to reveal your pixel art yet.
