## Set up your scene

In this step you will design your pixel art grid and scenery including walls or safe platforms. 

![A strip of four examples for the outputs of this step. The first is a vibrant pink option. The second uses green for the floor, yellow for the walls and blue for the plane. The third uses a black skybox and marble effects on the platforms. The fourth uses a marble effect on the floor, blue on the plane and pink and black walls.](images/output2-strip.png)

Edit the project settings to give your project a name such as 'Pixel art reveal' and save it to a sensible location. Then click **Create project**.

Your new project will open in the Unity Editor. It may take some time to load.

The Unity starter package you downloaded for this More Unity path contains a number of **Assets** for you to use in your project.

To import them into your new project, click on the **Assets menu** and select **Import package > Custom Packageâ€¦** then navigate to the downloaded Unity starter package.

In the pop-up window, name your Scene `Pixel Art Reveal`:

A new file will appear in the Assets folder in the Project window.

### Choose the size of your pixel art

--- task ---

**Choose:** a size for your pixel art. 

The 'Parts' folder in the 'Project' window contains **four** different size floors for you to choose from. You can choose:

+ 6 x 6
+ 8 x 8
+ 12 x 12
+ 16 x 16

A larger floor will allow you to create a more detailed image but it will take longer to create.
