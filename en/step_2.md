## Set up your scene

In this step, you will design your pixel art grid and scenery, including walls or safe platforms. 

![A strip of four examples for the outputs of this step. The first is a vibrant pink option. The second uses green for the floor, yellow for the walls, and blue for the plane. The third uses a black skybox and marble effects on the platforms. The fourth uses a marble effect on the floor, blue on the plane and pink and black walls.](images/output2-strip.png)

### Open your project

--- task ---

Launch the Unity Hub and open the project you created for [Don't fall through](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/dont-fall-through/0){:target='_blank'}.

If you are unable to open your project, launch the Unity Hub and click **Projects** then select **New project**:

Edit the project settings to give your project a sensible name and save it to a sensible location. Then click **Create project**:

![A screenshot of the right-hand pane in the Unity Hub. The filename and the 'Create Project' sections are highlighted in red.](images/create-project.png)

Your new project will open in the Unity Editor. It may take some time to load.

Download and unzip the [More Unity starter package](https://rpf.io/p/en/rainbow-run-go){:target="_blank"} to your computer. 

**Tip:** Choose a sensible location such as your Documents folder.

The Unity starter package you downloaded for this More Unity path contains a number of **Assets** for you to use in your project.

To import them into your new project, click on the **Assets** menu and select **Import package > Custom Packageâ€¦** then navigate to the downloaded Unity starter package.

In the **Project** panel, right-click and select **Create > Scene**.

![The right-click menu with 'Create' and 'Scene' highlighted.](images/create-scene.png)

In the pop-up window, name your Scene `Pixel Art Reveal`.

A new file will appear in the Assets folder in the Project window.

Drag the new Scene into the Scenes folder to organise your files.

### Choose the size of your pixel art

--- task ---

**Choose** a size for your pixel art. 

The Parts folder in the Project window contains **four** different size floors for you to choose from. You can choose:

+ 6 x 6
+ 8 x 8
+ 12 x 12
+ 16 x 16

A larger floor will allow you to create a more detailed image, but it will take longer to create.

--- task ---

**Drag** your chosen floor into the scene and change the floor's position to: 

X=`0`, Y=`0`, Z=`0`

--- /task ---

### Create your scenery

--- task ---

**Choose** the best view to build your scene in the Scene view. 

[[[unity-scene-top-down]]]

[[[unity-scene-navigation]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** how your floor will look. You could:

+ Add platforms at the beginning and end
+ Add platforms to each side of your grid
+ Add walls to keep the ball secure and stop it from falling off the edge
+ Add a plane that is larger than the floor

[[[unity-3d-objects]]]

[[[unity-transform-tools]]]

![Three examples showing different platform options. The first uses an extended plane underneath the floor. The second shows a platform at the beginning and end. The third uses four walls around the grid.](images/wall-strip-options.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** the materials for your GameObjects. 

You **don't** need to add materials to the tiled floor at this stage. 

[[[unity-existing-material]]]

[[[unity-material-with-texture]]]

[[[unity-glass-material]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose** the colour of your skybox and create it in your scene.

[[[unity-skybox]]]

--- /task ---

### Set up your camera view

--- task ---

**Choose** where to position your camera. Your viewer will need to see the whole floor in order to see the picture that is revealed. 

[[[unity-scene-top-down]]]

[[[unity-scene-navigation]]]

[[[unity-align-with-view]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test** your project by clicking **play**. Make sure that you are happy with:

+ The materials that you have chosen
+ Your skybox colour
+ The position of your camera
